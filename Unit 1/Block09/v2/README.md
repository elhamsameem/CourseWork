# Block09 Making a personal website

The website has three pages Home, About and Portfolio.
JS has been used to put out a hidden message in console and also to do some styling for navbar.
All content are actual expcept Portfolio page as I didn't have enough time to add actual info about my projects. However they are all linked to my github repo. 

Thank you for reading me!
