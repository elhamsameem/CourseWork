Guided Practice

Example 1:
Use if/else statements to create a JavaScript file that checks if a given value is even or odd. Complete the following steps:

Pseudocode the solution, writing your logic down in the IDE.
Turn your pseudocode into JavaScript logic.
Make checks with console.log.
Test with VS Codeâ€™s debugger.
Test with the browser debugger.
Write your solution in an alternative manner (ternary or single line if/else statements). 



Pseudocode: 

- Take an number as input
- Check if the number is divisible by 2
- if the number is divisible by 2, it is even
- if the number is not divisible by 2, it is odd
- Output the result in console
*/


const number = 5;

console.log(number % 2 === 0 ? `${number} is Even` : `${number} is Odd`);
